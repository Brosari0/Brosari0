### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rosario!

[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=brosari0&layout=compact)](https://github.com/brosari0/github-readme-stats)

<p>
  I am a dynamic and creative individual with a passion for music, education, and technology. With a diverse background in the entertainment, education, and gaming industries, I am skilled at adapting to new environments and excel in challenging situations. My experience as a table games dealer has honed my attention to detail and ability to think on my feet, while my software engineering skills in languages like JavaScript and Python allow me to tackle complex problems with a solutions-oriented mindset. As a musician and teacher, I am driven by a desire to share my knowledge and experience with others, and am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.
