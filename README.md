### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rosario!

[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=brosari0&layout=compact)](https://github.com/brosari0/github-readme-stats)

<p>I'm a JavaScript software engineer. My goal is to create and fix programs that will help people. Once I break into the tech industry I'd like to go back to college and get my bachelor's in Computer Science. I have a feeling I'll be able to accomplish a lot in my life and this is my first big step in that direction.
